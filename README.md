# AREA -> Action REAction (B-YEP-500)

## DESCRIPTION

> The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen through the creation of a business application.
To do this, we'll implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and/or Zapier.

This software suite will be broken into three parts :

- An application server to implement all the features listed below (see Features)
- A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
- A mobile client to use the application from your phone by querying the application server

- `FRONT-END:` `flutter`

- `BACK-END:` `nodejs`

- `DATABASE:` `mongodb`

- `DEPLOYMENT` `heroku`

## PREREQUISITES
What do you need to install ?
```bash
$ npm
$ nodejs
$ mongodb
$ flutter (Android Studio...)
```

## HOW TO BUILD
Clone the repository and setup env variables.

Go to the `server` folder and see the readme file to create your env variables before launching the project

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

To clean,
```bash
$ docker-compose down
```
